## Objective

Verification of CPU bus timing

#### timing1

This tests sync the CPU in the middle of each frame (magenta area). The CPU is run in a color loop that draws a grey shaded pattern. Bitplane DMA is off all the time and the Copper stopped.

#### timing2

Same as timing1 with a modified color loop.

#### timing3 

Same as timing2 with 4 lores bitplanes and the Copper enabled.

#### timing4 

Same as timing2 with 5 lores bitplanes and the Copper enabled.

#### timing5 

Same as timing2 with 6 lores bitplanes and the Copper enabled.

#### timing6 

Same as timing2 with 3 hires bitplanes and the Copper enabled.

#### timing7

Same as timing2 with 4 hires bitplanes and the Copper enabled.
