## Objective

This suite contains various very simple tests that read the value of a certain custom register and display the result in form of color bars. They are meant to exhibit the initial values of these registers. 

Note that most chip registers are already initialized when the test code runs. This means that the exhibitied value isn't the real initial value for most registers and the results may vary between Kickstart revisions. All test pictures are recorded on an A500 8A with Kickstart 1.3.

Register POT0DAT POT1DAT are not testes, because they return random values on startup.
