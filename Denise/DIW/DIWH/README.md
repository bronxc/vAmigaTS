These test utilize the Copper to modify DIWSTRT and DIWSTOP at locations close to the old trigger coordinate. 


### diwtim1b - diwtim4b

These test utilize the Copper to write trigger coordinates into DIWSTRT and DIWSTOP that are close to the current location. 

### minmax 

This test was mentioned in vAmiga GitHub issue 710. It sets DIWSTRT and DIWSTOP to very small and very high values, respectively. It can be used to determine the smallest and largest meaningful coordinate.
