## Objective

Tests the masking feature of WAIT and SKIP.

#### waitmask1 - waitmask8

Several masking tests for the WAIT command. waitmask1 runs with no bitplanes enabled. All other tests let the WAIT command interfere with bitplane DMA starting at different DDFSTRT positions.

#### skipmask1 - skipmask8

Adaptions of waitmask1 - waitmask8 for the SKIP command.
