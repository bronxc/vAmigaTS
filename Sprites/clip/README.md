## Objective

Verify basic properties of the drawable sprite area.

#### clip1 - clip3

These tests verify basic sprite clipping properties in lores mode. They differ in the shift value in BPLCON1.

#### clip1h - clip3h

Same as clip1 and clip2 in hires mode. 

#### newclip <n>

These tests verify basic sprite clipping properties in both lores and hires mode. Each test keeps DDFSTRT constant and varies the contents of BPLCON1.
