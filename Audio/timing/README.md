## Summary
---

### audtim1 - audtim7

Utilizes the Copper to write a data word into AUD0DAT in order to trigger an audio interrupt. The execution of the interrupt handler is visualized by color bars to verify timing. The test is carried out for different values in AUD0PER and AUDxLEN. 

### dmatim1 - dmatim8

Similar to the audtim tests, but for DMA driven audio.
