## Objective

Tests the value of BZERO flag.

#### zero *n*

Two blits are performed. The first one draws an emoji with different channels enabled. The BZERO flag must be false which is visualized by black background color. The second blit disables all channels forcing D to remain 0. Hence, the zero BZERO is true which is visualized by grey background color.
